**TaleScript** is a lightweight narrative tool for **Godot 4.4**, built with **C#** and extended via **Lua scripting**.  
It lets you script **dialogues**, **cutscenes**, **character actions**, and more — all in a clean, readable format.

Use Lua to control your 2D scenes with commands like:

- Displaying branching **dialogues**
- Moving **characters** and triggering **animations**
- Playing **sounds**, giving **items**, or opening **UI elements**
- Controlling **timing** with `async` functions thanks to the power of [Lua-CSharp](https://github.com/nuskey8/Lua-CSharp)

Whether you're building a story-rich RPG or a quirky visual novel, TaleScript gives you full control over your narrative flow — with a syntax that feels like writing the scene itself..
